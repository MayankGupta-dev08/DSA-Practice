Question 1: Following is the code for Largest 3 digit number from the 4 digit number:

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BruteForce {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scn.nextInt();
        //count of digits in n
        int temp=n;
        int count=0;
           while(temp!=0){
               count++;
               temp=temp/10;
           }

        int max=0;
        for(int i=count; i>=1; i--){

            int ans = (int)(n/Math.pow(10, i))*(power(10, i-1)) + (n%(power(10, i-1)));

            if(ans>max){
                max=ans;
            }

        }

        System.out.println(max);

    }

    public static int power(int x, int n){
        int ans=1;
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            ans=ans*x;
        }

        return ans;
    }


}

Dry run this code for n=8943 and try to appreciate how function calling works. 
Note: The video solution and complete dry on this question will be shared tomorrow. Today, you should try to solve it and get involved in it. 

Question 2: Probability Question
An urn contains 8 balls : 4 red , 2 blue and 2 green. Now n balls are drawn out of the urn. Calculate the probability that out of n drawn balls exactly x balls are red.
Find your answer multiplied by 100 and return the integer part. 
All required values for computation will be in integer range.
x is always less than equal to 4 and x is always less than equal to n. 

Input format :
    Two spaced integers : n and x
Output format :
    Integer part of (Probability * 100).
